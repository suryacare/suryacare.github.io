#### Introduction

If you are trying to understand your options for caring for senior family members for friends, you are in the right place. There are several options and the rest of this post goes into some level of detail on each of the options,

 * Independent Living Communities
 * Assisted Living
 * Nursing Homes
 * Speciality Care (Eg, Alzheimer's Care)
 * Residential Home Care
 * Respite Care
 * Home Care

#### Independent Living Communities
These communities are geared towards seniors who are very independent but have a few medical issues that require care. Residents live in fully equipped private homes. Given that these are communities, there's a good chance at social gatherings and finding people with similar interests to spend time with. 

Cost: These could cost any where from $1500 to $3500.

#### Assisted Living
These communities are geared towards seniors who are not able to live safely on their own but do not yet require the high level of care provided by nursing homes. There are nurses on duty at all hours of the day and seniors are assisted with food, medication and housekeeping. Guests live in private apartments that may have limited kitchen facilities.

Cost: These could cost any where from $2500 to $4000.

#### Nursing Homes
Nursing homes provide around-the-clock skilled nursing care for the frail elderly who require a high level of medical care and assistance.  Twenty-four hour skilled nursing services are available from licensed nurses. Many nursing homes now provide short-term rehabilitative stays for those recovering from an injury, illness or surgery. Long-term care residents generally have high care needs and complex medical conditions that require routine skilled nursing services. Residents typically share a room and are served meals in a central dining area unless they are too ill to participate.

Cost: These could cost any where from $4000 to $8000.

#### Speciality Care (Eg, Alzheimer's Care)
Numerous senior housing options for people with dementia or Alzheimer's are available. With memory impaired, it is important to have 24-hour support and structured activities to ensure their safety and quality of life. Many families try to care for their loved ones at home, which can be extremely difficult given the skill that is required to care for a person with memory problems. Generally, the residents live in semi-private apartments and have structured activities delivered by trained staff members. Most of these living environments have secured or locked areas to ensure no one wanders off. Many times, within the secured areas, residents have access to outdoor walking paths or gardens.

Cost: These could cost any where from $3000 to $7000.

#### Residential Home Care
Residential care homes are private homes that typically serve residents who live together and receive care from live-in caretakers. These homes offer assisted care services for seniors who want a more private, home-like community. Assistance with activities of daily living such as bathing and dressing are typically provided. Amenities and nursing services vary greatly between homes.

Cost: These could cost any where from $1500 to $3500, depending on services provided.

#### Respite Care
Respite care provides a temporary break for caregivers by allowing a resident to have a short-term stay in a community that can meet their needs. Many assisted living communities and nursing homes have a respite care program. Residents typically stay from a week to a month, depending on their situation. They receive all of the services of the community.  Respite stays may also serve as a "get acquainted" period for the senior. Many residents find that they enjoy their stay and decide to move in soon after the short-term visit. Respite programs are available for assisted living and Alzheimer's residents.

Cost: These could cost any where from $75 to $150 per day.

#### Home Care
Home care allows older people to remain in their own homes while receiving the assistance they need to help them remain independent.  Typically, home care involves providing assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) such as bathing, dressing and meal preparation or Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) such as transportation, paying bills, making appointments and simply being there to provide companionship and emotional support. Home care services range from once a week to 24 hours a day depending on the needs of the client.

Cost: These could cost any where from $20 to $40 per hour.
